# Painterly Rendering 3D Models via PatchMatch Algorithm

Developed by [Jiayi Chen](https://github.com/jia-yi-chen).

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of [StyLit](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2925948) by Jakub Fišer,et al.

## Requirements

Matlab 2017b +

## Getting Started

```
main_LPE.m
```
* input folder: /images (see [here](https://github.com/jia-yi-chen/3dModel-to-2dArt-Dataset) for the data)
* output folder: /results

## Result example
